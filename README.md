## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data, focusing on sentiment analysis and entity classification. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to gain insights from Twitter text data.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Explore the sentiment of Twitter data to understand public sentiment trends. This analysis categorizes tweets as 'Positive,' 'Negative,' 'Neutral,' or 'Irrelevant.'

- **Entity Classification:** Classify entities mentioned in tweets, providing context and categorization. Entities may include people, organizations, or topics discussed in the tweets.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess text data for accurate analysis and modeling. This includes removing special characters, tokenization, and lemmatization.

- **Word2Vec Embedding:** Employ Word2Vec word embedding to capture semantic meaning in text. This technique enhances the representation of words in the analysis.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize various classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to perform sentiment analysis and entity classification tasks.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning. Grid search and cross-validation are employed to fine-tune model parameters.

- **Classification Metrics:** Visualize and analyze classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis). It comprises a collection of Twitter data with the following attributes:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for each tweet.
- **Entity:** The entity or subject mentioned in the tweet.
- **Sentiment:** The sentiment associated with the tweet, categorized as 'Positive,' 'Negative,' 'Neutral,' or 'Irrelevant.'
- **Tweet:** The raw text of the tweet.

This dataset offers a valuable resource for conducting sentiment analysis and entity classification tasks. It can be used for various text analysis projects, including understanding public sentiment trends and categorizing tweets based on the mentioned entities.

Feel free to explore the dataset and use it in conjunction with the code and analysis provided in this repository to gain insights from Twitter data.
